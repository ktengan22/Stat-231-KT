# **About this lab** {-}

These exercises are designed to give you practice wrangling and tidying data, both from a *processes* perspective (what needs to be done to the data before I can run my fancy analysis and/or make my cool visualization?) and an *R implementation* perspective (how do I implement those steps specifically in R?).

In this lab we will work with the **tidyverse**, **datasets**, and **janitor** packages. The **datasets** package contains a dataset `state` with information on each state such as region.

These have been loaded for you in the `setup` code chunk, but scroll up to verify and load any packages that I may have missed (and of course install any packages that are not yet on your machine).


# **Exploring Health Expenditure using State-level data** {-}

This case study is based on an open case study from the OCS project (Kuo et al. 2019).

Health policy in the United States is complicated, and several forms of health care coverage exist, including both federal government-led health care policy, and private insurance company. Before making any inference about the relationship between health condition and health policy, it is important for us to have a general idea about health care economics in the United States. Thus, we are interested in getting a sense of the health expenditure, including health care coverage and health care spending, across the United States.

Motivating questions:

* Is there a relationship between health care spending and health care coverage by employers in the United States?
* How does the spending distribution change across geographic regions in the United States?
* Does the relationship between health care coverage and health care spending in the United States change from 2013 to 2014?


## The data {-}

Data for this lab come from the Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF).

* [Health Insurance Coverage of the Total Population (2013 -- 2016)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/)
     
* [Health Care Expenditures in millions by State of Residence (1991 -- 2014)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/health-care-expenditures-by-state-of-residence-in-millions/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D)

<!-- Part 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
#  <!-- 1 -->**Understanding the data** 

## <!-- 1.1 --> Since our goal is to get a sense of the health expenditure, including health care coverage and health care spending, across states, it would be nice add some information about each state. Namely, the state abbreviation and state region (i.e. north, south, etc). For this we use the various state datasets in the **datasets** R package.  Since the package is already loaded, we can refer directly to any of the state datasets (e.g., `state.abb`) even though we don't them loaded in our environment. However, we can make the `state` datasets appear in our environment by running `data(state)`. 

```{r}
# Load state datasets into environment
data(state) 
```

## <!-- 1.2 -->The state data are split across 7 datasets, all arranged according to alphabetical order of the state names. There are no other variables that can link the datasets together, so we will trust the alphabetical ordering and create our own dataframe from three of the datasets.

```{r}
# Create a data frame with state info
state_info <- data.frame(location = state.name, 
                         abbreviation = state.abb, 
                         region = state.region)
```

## <!-- 1.3 -->Run the code below to use `read_csv()` to read in the files containing the healthcare coverage and healthcare spending data. Pay attention to the filepath, making modifications if needed based on your own file organization. 

```{r}
coverage <- read_csv("data/healthcare_coverage.txt")
spending <- read_csv("data/healthcare_spending.txt")
```

## <!-- 1.4 -->Now get acquainted with the `coverage` and `spending` datasets.  What years are covered in the `coverage` dataset?  What years are covered in the `spending` dataset?  (Yes, the answers to these questions are above, but how can you confirm this in the datasets?) Are there any mismatches between how R specified the variable type and what you expected the type would be?

Using the `glimpse()` function, we can see the `coverage` dataset covers the years 2013 to 2016 and the `spending` dataset covers the years 1991 to 2014. We also see that the variables ending in "Other Public" are being treated as characters.

```{r}
glimpse(coverage)

glimpse(spending)
```

## <!-- 1.5 -->The previous question was intentionally leading---you should have identified some mismatched variable types in the `coverage` dataset. This happened because missing numeric values were recorded as text ("N/A") instead of left empty. Run the code below to fix this problem.

```{r}
coverage <- coverage %>% 
  na_if("N/A") %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = ends_with("Public"), 
                .fns = as.numeric))
```


## <!-- 1.6 -->If we're interested in the relationship between spending and coverage, we'll only be able to use observations that have information on both.  That is, we won't be using data from years for which we only have spending information or only have coverage information. Remove any variables we won't be using from `coverage` and `spending`.  *Hint*: the `starts_with()` function from the **tidyselect** package (already loaded) could help with efficiency here. 

```{r}
coverage2 <- coverage %>% 
  select(starts_with("2013"), starts_with("2014"), starts_with("L"))

spending2 <- spending %>% 
  select(starts_with("2013"), starts_with("2014"), starts_with("L"))
```

## <!-- 1.7 -->There are 50 states in the United States but 52 observations in the `coverage` and `spending` datasets. The two "bonus" cases contain information about the US as a whole and Washington DC.  Remove these observations from both datasets.

```{r}
coverage3 <- coverage2 %>% 
  filter(Location != "United States" & Location != "District of Columbia")

spending3 <- spending2 %>% 
  filter(Location != "United States" & Location != "District of Columbia")
```

<!-- Part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
# <!-- 2 -->**Is there a relationship between healthcare spending and healthcare coverage by employers in the United States?** We'll want to create a scatterplot with `log(spending)` on the $x$-axis and `log(employer coverage)` on the $y$-axis, with the points colored by year.  (*Why logs?* Both these variables are right-skewed and have large outliers; feel free to check out their histograms and/or look at the un-logged scatterplot if you'd like, as well.)  This is a simple enough scatterplot, but we'll need to do a bit of data tidying before the data are in an appropriate format to create the plot.

## <!-- 2.1 -->First, sketch what the scatterplot should look like on paper or Google jamboard or some other app (what are the axes? what does each point represent?). What does your dataset need to look like in order to create the scatterplot in `ggplot()`? What will each observation (row) in the dataset represent? What variables (columns) do you need?

The axes will be `log(spending)` on the x and `log(employer coverage)` on the y. Our dataset needs to include `log(spending)` from our `spending` dataset and `log(employer coverage)` from our `coverage` dataset. We will also want to specify the year that this is from. These will need to include both 2013 and 2014 data in one column. Each observation will represent data from one state. 


## <!-- 2.2 -->What are some of the steps that will need to be taken to get the data in that form?  

First, I will create smaller datasets with the variables of interest. Then, we need to combine 2013 and 2014 data in our datasets. This will include using `pivot_longer()` to combine that data for spending and coverage into one column. Then, I will mutate the data to collect the logarithms. 

## <!-- 2.3 -->Now implement those steps in R, tidying the dataset for plotting.  After the final step, use the `clean_names()` function from the **janitor** package to clean the variable names.  Then, create the scatterplot!

```{r}
#select relevant columns
coverage4 <- coverage3 %>% 
  select("Location", "2013__Employer", "2014__Employer", 
         "2013__Total", "2014__Total")

#change to longer, then wider to place types back into separate columns
coverage5 <- coverage4 %>% 
  pivot_longer(-Location, names_to = c("year", "type"), names_sep = "__", 
               values_to = "number")
coverage52 <- coverage5 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "type", 
              values_from = "number")

#create `loc_year` which creates unique identifiers based on location AND year
coveragej <- coverage52 %>% 
  unite('loc_year', Location:year, remove = FALSE)

#change to longer and create unique `loc_year` identifiers
spending5 <- spending3 %>% 
  pivot_longer(-Location, names_to = c("year", "type"), names_sep = "__", 
               values_to = "spending")
spendingj <- spending5 %>% 
  unite('loc_year', Location:year, remove = FALSE)

#join coverage and spending by loc_year
joined <- coveragej %>% 
  inner_join(spendingj, by = c("loc_year" = "loc_year"))
joined <- clean_names(joined)

ggplot(joined, mapping = aes(x = log(spending), y = log(employer), color = year_x)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Log(Healthcare spending in millions of dollars)", 
       y = "Log(Population covered by employer)", 
       title = "Employer coverage vs. healthcare spending", 
       subtitle = "United States in 2013 and 2014")
```

<!-- Part 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
# <!-- 3 -->**Adjusting for population size** We see there is a strong relationship between healthcare spending and coverage within each year. However, we might suspect that health care coverage and spending are each strongly related to population size.  In the `coverage` dataset, the "total" coverage category is not really a formal type of health care coverage; it actually represents the total number of people in the state in that year. This is useful information!  

## <!-- 3.1 -->Using the dataset you created in Part 2, rename the `total` column to  `total_population` to make the variable name more informative. Create a scatterplot of employer coverage versus population size (*note*: "plot blank vs blank" means "plot y variable vs x variable"). Then create a second scatterplot of healthcare spending vs. population size. What do you notice?

There is a strong positive linear relationship between both employer coverage and population size, along with healthcare spending and population size. This means that population size is strongly associated with both. 

```{r}
#create total population and select relevant columns
joined1 <- mutate(joined, total_population = total, location = location_x, 
                  year = year_x)
joined2 <- select(joined1, "loc_year", "location", "year", 
                  "total_population", "employer", 
                  "spending")

ggplot(joined2, mapping = aes(x = total_population/1000000, 
                              y = employer/1000000)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Population Size (millions)", 
       y = "Population with Employer Coverage (millions of people)", 
       title = "Employer coverage vs. Population size", 
       subtitle = "United States 2013 and 2014")

ggplot(joined2, mapping = aes(x = total_population/1000000, 
                              y = spending/1000)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Population Size (millions)", 
       y = "Healthcare Spending (billions of dollars)", 
       title = "Healthcare spending vs. Population size",
       subtitle = "United States 2013 and 2014")
```


## <!-- 3.2 -->To account for total population, create a scatterplot of spending per capita versus proportion with employer coverage.  This time, *color by region* and *facet by year* (think about what additional steps you need to take to make this happen!).  The total spending column is reported in millions (`1e6`). Therefore, to calculate `spending_per_capita` we will need to adjust for this scaling factor to report it on the original scale (just dollars) and then divide by `total_population`.  Based on this figure, write a brief paragraph describing the relationship between health care spending and coverage in the US.

Across the United States, there appears to be a moderately weak, positive linear relationship between health care spending and coverage. This trend remains relatively consistent from the years 2013 to 2014. However, when separating the United States into 4 regions and examining this relationship within those four regions, this same moderatley weak, positive linear relationship only seems to appear in the North Central and Southern regions. In the West and Northeast, there does not appear to be a significant linear relationship. Further, regions are clustered in different areas. The west tends to have lower healthcare spending, but employer coverage varies vastly. Meanwhile, employer coverage and spending are both relatively high in the northeast. The south and north central regions both tend to be near the median healthcare spending, but the north central generally has higher employee coverage. This means that employee coverage and healthcare spending trends do not tend to be homogenous among different regions in the US. 

```{r}
#add proportion covered by employer
joined3 <- mutate(joined2, spending_per_capita = spending*1e6/total_population, 
                  proportion_employer = employer/total_population)
joined4 <- joined3 %>% 
  inner_join(state_info, by = c("location" = "location"))

# #adding regions
# regionlist <- list(
#   South = c("Texas","Oklahoma","Arkansas","Louisiana","Mississippi","Alabama","Georgia","Florida","Tennessee","Kentucky","West Virginia","Virginia","North Carolina","South Carolina", "Maryland","Delaware"),
#   Northeast = c("Maine","New Hampshire","Vermont","Massachusetts","Connecticut","Rhode Island","New York","New Jersey","Pennsylvannia"),
#   Midwest = c("Ohio","Michigan","Illinois","Indiana","Wisconsin","Minnesota","Iowa","Missouri","North Dakota","South Dakota","Nebraska","Kansas"),
#   West = c("Alaska","Hawaii","Washington","Oregon","California","Nevada","Idaho","Utah","Arizona","New Mexico","Colorado","Wyoming","Montana")
# )
# regionconvert <- function(x, lookup) {
#   out <- x[NA]
#   for (nm in names(lookup)) {
#     ind <- x %in% lookup[[nm]]
#     out[ind] <- nm
#   }
#   return(out)
# }
# joined4 <- mutate(joined3, region = regionconvert(location, regionlist))

ggplot(joined4, mapping = aes(x = proportion_employer, 
                              y = spending_per_capita, 
                              color = region)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  labs(x = "Proportion of population with employer coverage", 
       y = "Healthcare spending per capita ($)", 
       color = "Region", 
       title = "Healthcare spending vs. Proportion with employer coverage", 
       subtitle = "United States in 2013 and 2014")

<!-- Part 4 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
# <!-- 4 -->**How does spending vary by state and region?**

## <!-- 4.1 -->Which US state spent the most per capita on health care in 2013? 2014? The least in each year?  

Alaska spends the most per capita on health care in 2013 and 2014. Utah spends the least in each year. 

```{r}
( joined5 <- joined4 %>% 
  arrange(desc(spending_per_capita)) %>% 
head(3) )

( joined6 <- joined4 %>% 
  arrange(spending_per_capita) %>% 
head(3) )
```

## <!-- 4.2 -->How does the spending distribution change across geographic region in the US?  Create an appropriate figure to visualize the distribution of spending per capita on health care by region.  Write one paragraph summarizing a comparison of the distributions.  (Note that you probably will also want to generate summary statistics by region in order to include specific values in your summary paragraph.)

The distributions appear relatively similar between 2013 and 2014. In the Northeast, spending per capita has a median of \$9500, which is the highest of the regions, and an IQR of \$300, which is the least spread of the regions. In the West, spending per capita has a median of \$7300, which is the lowest of all the regions, and an IQR of \$1200, which is the highest of the regions, and there is a large outlier above \$10000. In the North Central, spending per capita has a median of \$8100 and an IQR of \$350. In the South, spending per capita has a median of \$7500 and an IQR of \$400, and there are a few large outliers to the right. Spread is relatively symmetric in the Northeast but skewed right in all other regions. 

```{r}
ggplot(joined4, aes(x = spending_per_capita)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(vars(year), vars(region))

![](img/uninsured_spending_2013.png)

```{r, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 3.5}
#convert uninsured data to long table
coveragea <- coverage2 %>%
  select("Location", "2013__Uninsured", "2014__Uninsured")
coverageb <- coveragea %>%
  pivot_longer(-Location, names_to = c("year", "type"), names_sep = "__",
               values_to = "uninsured")
coveragec <- coverageb %>%
  unite('loc_year', Location:year, remove = FALSE)

#create healthcare dataset which includes number of uninsured by joining
healthcare <- joined %>%
  inner_join(coveragec, by = c("loc_year" = "loc_year"))
healthcare <- clean_names(healthcare)
healthcare <-  healthcare %>% 
  mutate(total_population = total) %>% 
  mutate(spending_per_capita = spending*1e6/total_population) %>% 
  inner_join(state_info, c("location" = "location")) %>% 
  select("loc_year", "location", "region", "abbreviation", "year", 
         "employer", "total_population", 
         "spending", "uninsured", "spending_per_capita")

# Add proportion uninsured to dataset
healthcare <- healthcare %>%
  mutate(proportion_uninsured = uninsured / total_population)

healthcare %>% 
  filter(year == "2013") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = spending_per_capita, y = proportion_uninsured, 
             color = region)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = abbreviation), nudge_x = 100) +
  labs(x = "Healthcare spending per capita (dollars)", 
       y = "Proportion of population uninsured", 
       color = "Region",
       title = "Proportion uninsured vs. Healthcare spending",
       subtitle = "United States in 2013")
```

## <!-- 5.2 -->Next, create an analogous plot (separately) for 2014. Does the relationship between health care spending and the proportion of uninsured change from 2013 to 2014?

The relationship between healthcare spending and the proportion uninsured looks pretty similar from 2013 to 2014.

```{r fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 3.5}
healthcare %>% 
  filter(year == "2014") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = spending_per_capita, y = proportion_uninsured, 
             color = region)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "darkorange") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = abbreviation), nudge_x = 100) +
  labs(x = "Healthcare spending per capita (dollars)", 
       y = "Proportion of population uninsured", 
       color = "Region",
       title = "Proportion uninsured vs. Healthcare spending",
       subtitle = "United States in 2013")
```

## <!-- 5.3 -->Now combine your two plots into one graph, creating one figure that is facetted by year and still colored by region. 

```{r fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 6}
healthcare %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = spending_per_capita, 
             y = proportion_uninsured, 
             color = region)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "darkorange") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = abbreviation), nudge_x = 100) +
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 1) +
  labs(x = "Healthcare spending per capita (dollars)", 
       y = "Proportion of population uninsured", 
       color = "Region",
       title = "Proportion uninsured vs. Healthcare spending",
       subtitle = "United States in 2013 and 2014")
```

## <!-- 5.4 -->Lastly, plot the points for both years on the same plot, this time colored by year instead of region.  Make sure to specify the `group` aesthetic for year as well to get two lines. Which of these three visualizations do you find most helpful for comparing the relationship between 2013 and 2014?  Why?

I think the last one where both years are on the same figure (colored by year instead of region) is most helpful for comparing the relationship between 2013 and 2014. We lose the visual cue of region, but it’s easiest for me to see the change in the relationship when the points and lines are on the same plot.

```{r fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 3.5}
healthcare %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = spending_per_capita, y = proportion_uninsured, 
             color = year, group = year)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = abbreviation), nudge_x = 100) +
  labs(x = "Healthcare spending per capita ($)", 
       y = "Proportion of population uninsured", 
       color = "Year",
       title = "Proportion uninsured vs. Healthcare spending",
       subtitle = "United States in 2013 and 2014")
```
